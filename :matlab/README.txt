This folder contains the code for the MATLAB CNN. 

-The two .m files contain the MATLAB code for the two convolutional neural networks. 

-The files labeled .txt contain the essays that need to be read in for speech recognition. 

-The files labeled .csv are datasets that are created by the different .m convolutional neural networks. They are provided here for extra context. 

-The files labeled .R contain the data analysis (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests)

NOTE: the .m files need the MATLAB software to run. The .R needs an R compiler, but the comments within the script contain the outputs.
