As a high school student, I have always been passionate about making a difference in the world. This desire led me to take on leadership roles in my school's community service club, where I organized various volunteering events to help those in need. Through these experiences, I realized that my true passion lies in advocating for marginalized communities.
Growing up as an Asian-American in a predominantly white community, I have personally experienced the effects of discrimination and microaggressions.
